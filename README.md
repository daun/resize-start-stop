Debounced `resizestart` and `resizestop` events on the window. Great for
disabling transitions and animations during window resize.

## Installation

```bash
npm install resize-start-stop
```

## Usage

Import and call `bindResizeEvents()` to install debounced `resizestart` and
`resizestop` events on the window.

```js
import { bindResizeEvents } from 'resize-start-stop'

bindResizeEvents()

window.addEventListener('resizestart', () => { console.log('Start') })
window.addEventListener('resizestop', () => { console.log('Stop') })
```

### Toggle class name during resize

The package includes a helper for the most common use case: toggling a
class name on the `html` element during resize.

```js
import { toggleClassDuringResize } from 'resize-start-stop'

// Default options
toggleClassDuringResize({
  className: 'is-resizing',
  element: document.documentElement,
  wait: 200
})
```

### Cleaning up

If you don't need the installed events anymore, import and call
`unbindResizeEvents()`.

```js
import { bindResizeEvents, unbindResizeEvents } from 'resize-start-stop'

// Bind events
bindResizeEvents()

// Unbind at later stage
unbindResizeEvents()
```

### In the browser

If you don't have the luxury of using a bundler, you can also
simply include the script tag and call it a day.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/resize-start-stop"></script>
<script>
  resizeStartStop.bindResizeEvents()
</script>
```
